                <div><b>General Information</b></div>
                <div style={{fontSize:'15px'}}><p>The court has just made a child support order in your case. This order will remain the same unless a party to the action requests that the support be changed (modified). An order for child support can be modified only by filing a motion to change child support and serving each party involved in your case. If both parents and the local child support agency (if it is involved) agree on a new child support amount, you can complete, have all parties sign, and file with the court a <i>Stipulation to Establish or Modify Child Support and Order (form FL-350) or Stipulation and Order (Governmental) </i>(form FL-625).</p></div><br />
                <div><b>When a Child Support Order May Be Modified</b></div>
                <div style={{fontSize:'15px'}}><p>The court takes several things into account when ordering the payment of child support. First, the number of children is considered. Next, the net incomes of both parents are determined, along with the percentage of time each parent has physical custody of the children. The court considers both parties’ tax filing status and may consider hardships, such as a child of another relationship. An existing order for child support may be modified when the net income of one of the parents changes significantly, the parenting schedule changes significantly, or a new child is born.</p></div><br />
                <div><b>Examples</b></div>
                <div style={{fontSize:'15px'}}>

                            <li>•	You have been ordered to pay $500 per month in child support. You lose your job. You will continue to owe $500 per month, plus 10 percent interest on any unpaid support, unless you file a motion to modify your child support to a lower amount and the court orders a reduction.</li>
                            <li>•	You are currently receiving $300 per month in child support from the other parent, whose net income has just increased substantially. You will continue to receive $300 per month unless you file a motion to modify your child support to a higher amount and the court orders an increase.</li>
                            <li>•	You are paying child support based upon having physical custody of your children 30 percent of the time. After several months it turns out that you actually have physical custody of the children 50 percent of the time. You may file a motion to modify child support to a lower amount.</li>
